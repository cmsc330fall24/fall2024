What happens in each phase?
Lex - Literal list of tokens - nothing but converting string to list or failing on unknown stuff
Parse - Grammar check!
Evaluate - Given a gramatically correct structrue, what is its meaning?

ASTs and Parse Trees:

Parse Tree:

You know how you would parse something like this:

4 + true and false
S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M -> 4 + N and M -> 4 + true and M -> 4 + true and N -> 4 + true and false

Parse trees are just another represenatation of this same process. Let's build one:

S: just S

        S

S -> M + S: S split into M, +, S

           S
      /    |    \
    M      +     S

S -> M + S -> N + S: M turned into N

           S
      /    |    \
    M      +     S
  /
N

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S: N turned into 4

           S
      /    |    \
    M      +     S
  /
N
|
4

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M: S turned into M

           S
      /    |    \
    M      +     S
  /              |
N                M
|
4

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M -> 4 + N and M: M turned into N and M

           S
      /    |    \
    M      +     S
  /              |
N                M
|           /    |    \
4          N    and    M

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M -> 4 + N and M -> 4 + true and M: N turned into true

           S
      /    |    \
    M      +     S
  /              |
N                M
|           /    |    \
4          N    and    M
           |
         true

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M -> 4 + N and M -> 4 + true and M -> 4 + true and N: M turned into N

           S
      /    |    \
    M      +     S
  /              |
N                M
|           /    |    \
4          N    and    M
           |           |
         true          N

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M -> 4 + N and M -> 4 + true and M -> 4 + true and N -> 4 + true and false: N turned into false 

           S
      /    |    \
    M      +     S
  /              |
N                M
|           /    |    \
4          N    and    M
           |           |
         true          N
                       |
                     false

leftmost derivation done! leftmost parse tree done!

Ok, how about ASTs? Way less easily defined, as it's basically in terms of "operators" and "operands" rather than a direct derivation
So if we agree that x+y is the operator + on the operands x and y, the AST for "x + y" is Add(x,y), visualized like this:

       operator
       /     \
operand1     operand2

Let's do the same sequence of steps we did before, now building an AST instead of a parse tree

4 + true and false
S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M -> 4 + N and M -> 4 + true and M -> 4 + true and N -> 4 + true and false

S: no operator, let's put a placeholder

         (S)

S -> M + S: (S) is actually an Add operator! acting on whatever (M) is and whatever (S) is. We don't know what those are yet.

          +
       /     \
     (M)      (S)

S -> M + S -> N + S: (M) = whatever (N) is. We don't know what that is yet.

          +
       /     \
     (N)      (S)

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S: (N) = 4. Thank god, something we know! 4!

          +
       /     \
     4       (S)

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M: (S) = whatever (M) is. We don't know what that is yet.

          +
       /     \
     4       (M)

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M -> 4 + N and M: (M) = And operator! acting on whatever (N) is and whatever (M) is. We don't know what those are yet.

          +
       /     \
     4        and
             /   \
           (N)    (M)

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M -> 4 + N and M -> 4 + true and M: (N) is true!

          +
       /     \
     4        and
             /   \
          true    (M)

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M -> 4 + N and M -> 4 + true and M -> 4 + true and N: (M) is whatever (N) is.

          +
       /     \
     4        and
             /   \
          true    (N)

S -> M + S -> N + S -> 4 + S -> 4 + M -> 4 + N and M -> 4 + true and M -> 4 + true and N -> 4 + true and false: (N) is false!

          +
       /     \
     4        and
             /   \
          true   false

If you are asked for a derivation, DO A DERIVATION (*not* a parse tree or abstract syntax tree)
If you are asked for a parse tree, DO A PARSE TREE (*not* a derivation or abstract syntax tree)
If you are asked for an abstract syntax tree, DO AN AST (*not* a derivation or parse tree)

These are not the same, and though you may get some small amount of partial credit, don't count on it.


Example problems I liked/made up:
Q: Does it fail at lexing stage, parsing stage, evaluating stage, or pass completely?

1: Classic case!

E → M and E | M or E | M
M → N + M | N − M | N
N → 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | true | false | (E)

1.a: 1 + 2 - (true and false)
1.b: true + {3 - 2} 
1.c: 1 * 3
1.d: 22

1.a: eval
1.b: lex
1.c: lex
1.d: parse

2: It could be stupid!

E → M and G | M or G | M
M → N + M | N − M | N
N → 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
G → true | false

2.a: true and false
2.b: true and true and false
2.c: 1 + 2
2.d: 1 + false
2.e: (true)

2.a: parse
2.b: parse
2.c: succeeds
2.d: eval
2.e: lex

3: It could be gross!

E → + E E | ∗ E E | sq E | ex p E E | and E E |or E E | N
N → 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | true | false

3.a: - + 1 23
3.b: true and false or true
3.c: and true or false false
3.d: * 2 and true false

3.a: lex
3.b: parse
3.c: succeeds
3.d: eval

TL;DR:

Does it fail lexer = are all the symbols somewhere in the Grammar?
    (ex: it's a string but grammar does not allow strings, it's a + but grammar only defines * and -, it's a 5 but grammar only defines 4, etc.)
Does it fail parser = can you make a derivation for it using this Grammar?
    (just make a derivation for it. they should be short and simple.)
Does it fail evaluator = given the defined behavior, could the operations succeed? 
    (ex: is it ever trying to + things that are not two bools, ^ things that are not two strings, etc.)
