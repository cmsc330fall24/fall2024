## Review - Imperative OCaml

```ocaml
# let z = 3;;
  val z : int = 3
# let x = ref z;;
  val x : int ref = {contents = 3}
# let y = x;;
  val y : int ref = {contents = 3}
```
Here, `z` is bound to 3. It is immutable.  `x` and `y` are bound to a reference. The `contents` of the reference is mutable. 
```ocaml
x := 4;;
```
will update the `contents` to 4. `x` and `y` now point to the value 4. 
```ocaml
!y;;
  - : int = 4
```
Here, variables y and x are aliases. In `let y = x`, variable `x` evaluates to a location, and `y` is bound to the same location. So, changing the contents of that location will cause both `!x` and `!y` to change.

## Exercises

### Imperative OCaml Counter

**Recall:** The `unit` type means that no input parameters are required for the function.

Implement a counter called `counter`, which keeps track of a value starting at 0. Then, write a function called `next: unit -> int`, which returns a new integer every time it is called.

#### Example
```ocaml
(* First call of next () *)
# next ();;
 : int = 1

(* First call of next () *)
# next ();;
 : int = 2
```

#### Solution:
<details>
  <summary><b>Click here!</b></summary>
  
```ocaml
# let counter = ref 0 ;;
val counter : int ref = { contents=0 }

# let next = 
    fun () -> counter := !counter + 1; !counter ;;
val next : unit -> int = <fun>
```
</details>

### Function argument evaluation order 

What happens when we run this code?
```ocaml
let x = ref 0;;
let f _ r = r;;
f (x:=2) (!x)
```
#### Solution:
<details>
  <summary><b>Click here!</b></summary>
Ocaml's order of argument evaluation is not defined. On some systems it's left to right on others it's right to left.
    
On my system, <b>f</b> evaluates to <b>0</b>, but on your system it may evaluate to <b>2</b>!   
</details>

## Property-Based Testing

Why do we even care about property-based testing and what do we need to know about them?

Suppose you write a function `square` to calculate the square of a number.

```ocaml
let square x = (* square an integer*)
```

Now you want to test whether your implementation is correct. One way to go about this is creating unit tests

```ocaml
square 3 = 9
square 4 = 16
square (-1) = 1
```

Writing unit tests can get tedious, though. This is where property-based testing comes in; the purpose of PBTs is to test whether some property of a function behaves as expected, *independent of input*. Now, where can PBTs go wrong?

Consider the following attempt at a property-based test for a `length` function:

```ocaml
let length lst = (* calculate length of a list *)

let delete x lst = (* return a list without x *)

length(delete x lst) < length lst 
```

This property says that if you delete an item from a list, the size of the list should be smaller than when it started. This sounds right, but *is false if the item to be deleted was not actually in the list*. In this case, the list size stays the same so this is not a valid property.

**So we can ask: given a property $p$, is $p$ actually valid?**


Now suppose we have a valid property. For example, we know that reversing a list twice should return the original list, for any list. If we translated this into code as:

```ocaml
let rev lst = (*reverse a list*)
rev (lst) = lst
```
then we did not accurately translate the property, since this code doesn't actually do what we want!

**So we can ask: given a property $p$ and a function $f$ encoding $p$, does $f$ actually represent $p$?**

Finally, while the property could be valid, and while the function we write could be a correct encoding, it is possible the property we are testing is not meaningful. Consider the following:

```ocaml
rev (rev lst) = lst
```
This is clearly a valid property from our discussion earlier, and a valid encoding of the property. However, imagine we wrote `rev` like

```ocaml
let rev lst = lst
```
Then this property will not actually detect the bug in my code (namely the fact that `rev` is completely incorrect).

**So we can ask, given a valid property $p$, and a buggy implementation of this function $f$, will the property $p$ catch any bugs in $f$?**

## Review - Regular Expressions
There are many patterns regex can describe aside from string literals.

- **Concatenation (and)**: `/ab/` We use this to accept something that satisfies a and b in that order, where a and b can denote sub-regex.
    - Ex. `/a/` matches "a", `/b/` matches "b", so `/ab/` matches "ab"
    - Ex. `/(a|b)/` matches "a" or "b", `c` matches "c", so `/(a|b)c/` matches "ab" or "ac"
- **Union (or)**: `/a|b|c/` We use this to accept something from given choices. **Note** that a, b, or c can also denote sub-regex if parentheses are specified.
    - Ex. `/a|b|c/` matches "a" or "b" or "c"
- **Precedence (parentheses)**: `/(a)/` are used to enforce order of evaluation and capture groups.
    - Ex. `/a|bc/` matches "a" or "bc". This is the same as `/a|(bc)/`
    - Ex. `/(a|b)c/` matches "ab" or "ac"
- **Sets**: `/[abc]/` We use this to accept one character from the given choices.
    - Ex. `/[abc]/` matches "a" or "b" or "c"
- **Ranges**: `/[a-z]/`, `/[c-k]/`, `/[A-Z]/`, `/[0-9]/` We use these ranges, also known as character classes, to accept characters within a specified range (inclusive).
    - Ex. `/[a-z]/` matches any lowercase letter
    - Ex. `/[c-k]/` matches letters c to k inclusive
    - Ex. `/[A-Z]/` matches any uppercase letter
    - Ex. `/[0-9]/` matches any digit
    - Ex. `/[a-z0-9]/` matches any lowercase letter or digit
- **Negation**: `/[^abc]/` `/[^a-z]/` `/[^0-9]/` We use these to exclude a set of characters.
    - Ex. `/[^abc]/` matches with any character other than "a", "b", or "c"
    - Ex. `/[^a-z]]/` matches with any character that is not a lowercase letter
    - Ex. `/[^0-9]/` matches with any character that is not a digit
    - Note that the use of "^" differs from the beginning of a pattern
- **Meta Characters**: `/\d/`, `/\D/`, `/\s/`, `\w`, `\W` We use these characters to match on any of a particular type of pattern.
    - ex. `/\d/` matches any digit (equivalent to `/[0-9]/`)
    - ex. `/\D/` matches any character that is not a digit (equivalent to `/[^0-9]/`)
    - ex. `/\s/` matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, or newlines)
    - ex. `/\w/` matches any alphanumeric character from the basic Latin alphabet, including the underscore (equivalent to `/[A-Za-z0-9_]/`)
    - ex. `/\W/` matches any character that is not a word character from the basic Latin alphabet (equivalent to `/[^A-Za-z0-9_]/`)
- **Wildcard**: `.` We use this to match on **any** single character. Note: to use a literal `.`, we must escape it, i.e. `/\./`
- **Repetitions**: `/a*/`, `/a+/`, `/a?/`, `/a{3}/`, `/a{4,6}/`, `/a{4,}/`, `/a{,4}/`:
    - Ex. `/a*/` matches with 0 or more a's
    - Ex. `/a+/` matches with at least one a
    - Ex. `/a?/` matches with 0 or 1 a
    - Ex. `/a{3}/` matches with exactly three a's
    - Ex. `/a{4,6}/` matches with 4, 5, or 6 a's
    - Ex. `/a{4,}/` matches with at least 4 a's
    - Ex. `/a{,4}/` matches with at most 4 a's
    - **Note**: a can denote a sub-regex
- **Partial Match**: `/a/` and `/abc/` These patterns can match any part of a string that contains the specified characters.
    - Ex. `/a/` matches "a", "ab," "yay," or "apple"
    - Ex. `/abc/` matches "abc", "abcdefg," "xyzabcjklm," or "abc123"
    - **Note**: They do not require the specified sequence to be at the beginning or end of the string
- **Beginning of a pattern**: `/^hello/` The string must begin with "hello".
    - Ex. `/^hello/` matches with "hellocliff" but does not match with "cliffhello"
- **End of a pattern**: `/bye$/` The string must end with "bye".
    - Ex. `/bye$/` matches with "cliffbye" but does not match with "byecliff"
- **Exact Match**: `/^hello$/` The string must be exactly "hello".
    - Ex. `/^hello$/` only matches "hello" and no other string
    - **Note**: Enforces both the beginning and end of the string

> **Question**: *Can every string pattern be expressed with a regex?*

**Answer**: No!

There are certain string patterns that **cannot** be expressed with regex. This is because regex is memoryless; as they cannot keep track of what they have already seen.

As an example, consider a palindrome "racecar". We can't track how many of each character we have previously seen (assuming our regex engine doesn't have backreferences).

## Exercises - Regular Expressions

Write a regex pattern for each of the following scenarios (or explain why you cannot):

1. **Exactly** matches a string that alternates between capital & lowercase letters, starting with capital letters.
    - Includes: "AaBbCc", "DlFsPrOa", "HiWoRlD"
    - Excludes: "aAbBcC", "aaa", "123"
2. Matches a string that contains an even number of 3s, and then an odd number of 4s.
    - Includes: "3333444", "334", "3333334444444", "4"
    - Excludes: "34", "33344", "334444", "1111222"
3. Matches a string that contains a phone number following the format (XXX)-XXX-XXXX where X represents a digit.
    - Includes: "(123)-456-7890", "(111)-222-3333"
    - Excludes: "123-456-7890", "1234567890"
4. **Exactly** matches a string email following the format [Directory ID]@umd.edu where [Directory ID] is any sequence consisting of lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), or digits (0-9) with length >= 1.
    - Includes: "colemak123@umd.edu", "ArStDhNeIo@umd.edu", "a@umd.edu"
    - Excludes: "qwerty@gmail.com", "@umd.edu"
5. Matches a string that has more 7s, 8s, and 9s than 1s, 2s, and 3s.
    - Includes: "7891", "123778899", "12789", "8"
    - Excludes: "1", "271", "12399", "831"

1. `/^([A-Z][a-z])*([A-Z])?$/`
2. `/(33)*4(44)*/`
3. `/\([0-9]{3}\)-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}/` (Note, we have to escape the parenthesis with `\`)
4. `/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+@umd\.edu$/` (Note, we have to escape the period with `\`)
5. Cannot be represented with regular expressions, since there is no memory of which numbers have been previously used.
