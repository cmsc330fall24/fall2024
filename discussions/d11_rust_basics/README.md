### Properties of Rust

Rust is type-safe, meaning a well-typed program has a defined behavior and does not get "stuck".

Languages like C are not type-safe. This is due to the ability for pointers to point to garbage parts of memory.

- Rust's type safety limits some of its capabilities for the sake of this safety
- The **unsafe** keyword can be used to write unsafe Rust.

### Rust Syntax

#### Statements

```rust
// Here is how print statements will be written:
println!("This statement will be printed!");
```

Note that the '!' symbol is placed at this "function" call, denoting that this is not a normal function. This is actually a **macro**, meaning the code will be replaced at compile time.

As with most languages, string literals are wrapped with quotation marks. 

The end of this statement has a semicolon, denoting the end of the expression.

#### Functions

```rust
// This is the main function.
fn main() {
    
}
```

The main function is where every rust program starts. 

Similar to most languages you've seen before, functions in Rust are denoted using parentheses for their input parameters and curly braces wrapping the body.

```rust
fn add1(x: i32, y: i32) {
    x + y // Note lack of semi-colon. That means this expression is returned! Equivalent to `return x + y;`
}
// to call this:
add1(2, 3) // will return 5
```

#### Variables and Bindings

```rust
let x = 5; // x: i32
```
In this example, we are binding the value 5 to the variable x. Rust has type inference, so we don't need to explicitly state the type of x here. 

However, we can still explicitly give the type:

```rust
let x: i32 = 5;
```

[Here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html) is some more information about Rust's primitive types.

As with OCaml, bindings are effectively a type of pattern matching.
Because of this, we can still do things like this:

```rust
let (x, y) = (1, 2);
```

#### Mutable Variables

In Rust, bindings are not mutable by default. This following code will not compile:

```rust
let x = 5;
x = 6;
```

Attempting to compile this code will give this error:

```
error: re-assignment of immutable variable `x`
     x = 6;
     ^~~~~~
```

If you want to make a variable mutable, you must use the **mut** keyword.

```rust
let mut x = 5; // x is now mutable
x = 6; // this is a valid statement
```

#### Conditionals and Loops

```rust
let mut x = 2;
x = if x < 0 { 10 } else { x }
```

If statements in Rust do not have parentheses around the guard clause. Note that conditional branches must evaluate to the same type as is in OCaml.

```rust
let mut x = 10;
loop {
    if x <= 0 {
        break;
    }
    println!("This statement is printed 10 times.");
    x = x - 1;
}
```

Using the generic "loop" is an infinite loop, which can only be exited using break. Similar to other languages, `break;` exits from the loop and `continue;` jumps to the next loop iteration.

```rust
let mut x = 10;
while x > 0 {
    println!("This statement is printed 10 times.");
    x = x - 1;
}
```

Similar to if statements, while loops don't have parentheses around the guard. Observe that iterating using `loop {}` is the same as iterating with `while true {}`.

```rust
for x in 0..10 { 
    println!("{}", x); // prints numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9
}
```

For loops in Rust are analogous to "for each" loops in Java. If we are looking for variables in a range of numbers, remember that it is **inclusive** of the first number and **exclusive** of the last number.

Abstractly, they follow the structure:

```rust
for var in expression {
    // code
}
```

Additionally, you can loop through an iterable object in the following way:

```rust
some_list.iter().foreach(|x| //do something )
```

This syntax is called a closure, and (for our purposes) is equivalent to ocaml's anonymous function `(fun x -> //do something)`

We can also call map/fold like in ocaml to do iteration!

```rust
    let x = vec![1,2,3]; // a vec is a list of a variable size! This line is creating a vec of the list 1,2,3
  
    let y: Vec<i32> = x.iter().map(|x| x + 1).collect(); //collect() is called to turn it from a "map object" type to the type we want (if it can)
    let z: i32 = x.iter().fold(0, |acc, ele| acc + ele); // Here, 0 is the init value

    println!("{:?}", y); // [2, 3, 4]
    println!("{:?}", z); // 6
```


#### Pattern Matching

```rust
let x = 5;

match x {
    1 => println!("one"),
    2 => println!("two"),
    3 => println!("three"),
    4 => println!("four"),
    5 => println!("five"),
    _ => println!("something else"),
}
```

Match statements work similarly to those in OCaml, but the syntax is slightly different.

In Rust, match statements enforce **exhaustive** checking.
If a statement is not exhaustive, it will give the following error:

```
error: non-exhaustive patterns: `_` not covered
```

### Ownership
We implement copy traits (like implementing interfaces in java). Redefining variables with copy traits (primitives, bool, char) creates copy of values (multiple owners).

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!("{} = 5!", y); //ok
println!("{} = 5!", x); //ok
```
Redefining variables without copy traits transfers ownership

```rust
let x = String::from("hello");
let y = x; // x transfers ownership to y

println!("{}, world!", y); // ok
println!("{}, world!", x); // fails
```

#### References

When defining variables, take note of the following:
- **mut**: an object/primitive has the ability to update (ex. Array or Integer)
- **&**: Borrowing a reference for a variable, useful when you want to pass a variable to a function without updating it
- **&mut**: A mutable reference to a variable (must be defined mut). Comes particularly handy when you want to pass a variable to another function and have it updated.

> At any given time, you can have either *but not both* of **one mutable reference** or **any number of immutable references**.

#### Rules of References
1) At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference XOR any number of immutable references.
2) References must always be valid (no dangling references - will cover later).

Refer to [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html) for more information!

An example of borrowing a reference.
```rust
fn main() {
     let s1 = String::from("hello");
     let len = calc_len(&s1); // lends reference
     println!("the length of {} is {}",s1,len);
}

fn calc_len(s: &String) -> usize {
     //  s.push_str(“hi”); fails! refs are immutable
     s.len()    // s dropped; but not its referent
}
```

An example of borrowing a mutable reference.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::from("hello");
    append_world(&mut s1); // lends mutable reference, note s1 must be mutable
    println!("s1 is now {}", s1);
}

fn append_world(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(" world!");
}
```

#### Scopes

**Scopes** of a variable extend as far as defined/freed (between curly braces). **Lifetimes** span as long as the variable lives. A variable's lifetime ends the line after the last time it is used.

```rust
{
    let x = 3; 
    { // x lifetime ends
        let y = 4;
        println!("{}", y);
    } // scope of y ends, y lifetime ends
    
    let z = 5
    println!("Hello World!"); // z lifetime ends
} // scope of x, z ends
```

We can not have an immutable/mutable reference at the same time. 
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = String::from("Hello");
    x.push_str(" World");
    {
        let y = &x;
        // x.push_str(", I am an alien!"); // error! x is turned to an immutable reference
        println!("{} and {} can only read, no write", x, y);
        x.push_str(", I am an alien!"); // y lifetime ends so this is ok
    }
    
    x.push_str("!");
    println!("{} is still valid", x);
}
```

In the above, x becomes immutable for as long as y lives (until line 6). Here is another example with &mut.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::from("hello");
    { 
        let s2 = &s1;
        //s2.push_str(" there"); //disallowed; s2 immutable
    }   //s2 dropped
    let s3 = &mut s1; //ok since s1 mutable
    s3.push_str(" there"); //ok since s3 mutable
    // println!("String is {}",s1); //NOT OK, s3 has mutable borrow
    println!("String is {}",s3); //ok; 
    println!("String is {}",s1); //ok; s3 dropped
}
```

### Compiling Rust

#### Using Rustc

Rust files are compiled in the command line using **rustc**, a compiler that was built in Rust.

```
$ rustc main.rs
```

Similar to compiling C with gcc, this creates an executable file.

```
$ ls
main  main.rs
```

To execute the file, simply run `./main`.

#### Using Cargo

Cargo is a Rust package manager. It can download Rust crates and invoke the compiler (rustc) on them.

Basic Cargo commands:
- `cargo check` runs a syntax check on the code
- `cargo build` compiles the code
- `cargo test` will run tests
- `cargo run` will run the code directly
    - If your code has changed since last time it was compiled, `cargo run` will recompile the code and then run it.


## Exercises

1.  Write a function `is_prime` that given an integer, returns true if the integer is prime and false if the integer is composite. Then, wite a `main` function that tests your `is_prime` function by printing `i is prime!` or `i is composite!` for integers `1 <= i <= 500`. Then, print the number of integers `i` we found to be prime in the format `We found [answer] primes from 1 to 500!`. Finally, compile and run your code!

Some expressions that might be useful:
- `fn is_prime(n: u32) -> bool` should be the function header
- `(n as f64).sqrt() as u32` will find the square root of n and floor it
- `%` is the modulus operator

Challenge: Can you do it faster than $O(n^{\frac{3}{2}}$? :)
