## Lambda Calculus Review
*Refer to [Cliff's Lambda Calculus Notes](https://bakalian.cs.umd.edu/assets/notes/lambdacalc.pdf) for a complete resource.*

### Bound vs. Free Variables
- A bound variable is one who’s value is dependent on a parameter of
a lambda function.
- A free variable is a variable that is not a bound variable: its value is **independent** of lambda function parameters.
```scheme
(λx. x a ) b
     ↑ x is a bound variable
     
(λx. x a ) b
       ↑ a is a free variable
       
(λx. x a ) b
           ↑ b is a free variable
```

### Explicit Rules to remove ambiguity
- Expressions $e$ are left associative
```
a b c means (a b) c
```
- The scope of a function goes until the **end of the entire expression** or until a (unmatched) parenthesis is reached
```
λx .λy. a b means λx. (λy. (a b))
```

### Alpha Conversion
- An alpha-conversion ($\alpha$-conversion) is the process of renaming all the variables that are bound together along with the bounded parameter to a different name to increase readability.
```scheme
(λx. (λx. (λy. x y)) x) x → 
(λa. (λb. (λy. b y)) a) x            Alpha Conversion
```

### Beta Reduction
- The process of of applying a function is called reducing. We call a function call a beta reduction ($\beta$-reduction).
```scheme
(λx. λy. y x) a b →
((λx. λy. y x) a) b →          Left associativity
(λy. y a) b →                  Beta reduce the x function
b a                            Beta reduce the y function
```
- When you cannot reduce any further, we say the expression is in beta normal form.

### Eager vs. Lazy Evaluation
- Eager Evaluation (Call by Value): Before doing a beta reduction, we make sure the argument cannot, itself, be further evaluated:

```scheme
(λz. z) ((λy. y) x) →          
(λz. z) x →                    We evaluate the argument first!
x
```

- Lazy Evaluation (Call by Name): We can specifically choose to perform beta-reduction _before_ we evaluate the argument:

```scheme
(λz. z) ((λy. y) x) →
(λy. y) x →                    We apply the function (beta-reduce) first!
x
```

### Exercises

**Make the parentheses explicit in the following expressions:**

1. `a b c`

2. `λa. λb. c b`

3. `λa. a b λa. a b`

**Identify the free variables in the following expressions:**

4. `λa. a b a`

5. `a (λa. a) a`

6. `λa. (λb. a b) a b`

**Apply alpha-conversions to the following:**

7. `λa. λa. a`

8. `(λa. a) a b`

9. `(λa. (λa. (λa. a) a) a)`

**Apply beta-reductions to the following:**

10. `(λa. a b) x b`

11. `(λa. b) (λa. λb. λc. a b c)`

12. `(λa. a a) (λa. a a)`

**Consider the following subset of the church encodings:**

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{true} &\equiv \lambda x.\lambda y.x\\
\text{false} &\equiv \lambda x.\lambda y.y\\
\text{if a then b else c} &\equiv a\ b\ c
\end{align*}
$$

Convert the following sentences to their equivalent lambda calc encodings:

13. `if true then false else true`
14. `if false then if false then false else true else false`

Next, reduce the lambda calc expressions to their simplest form. Verify that the resulting expression is equivalent to the english sentence when evaluated.
